2 Purposes of this document. I accept contructive fedback and plan on the great resource of oter devs citirazizqking what I am trying to do here and admitting this has almost certanly been done before maybe even better but by doing this I am becoming 
1. Devs looking for mastery of their craft with the goal to be a Senior Full stack Developer (That is me)
 although some of this will not be new its the holistic nature of the read me that may help and follow thorugh on mastery of chosen  
2. Someon who is wondering if they shoud do a bootcamp, self teach how to code. and if so where to start. 

READING CODE = if you know the vaculary and function  is very useful  so study for HTLM cool website jsut pull up google chrome and read the code. study it - if anything seems new google it and note it down copy and paste it in to a ongoing sandbox folder. 

READ ME TUROIALS - KEY IF the tutiral is well done it will work but iwth almost all cases code is exact so instaead of trying to make someting work form jsut reading it - alwasy clone the whole repo and get it working on your set up perfectly as intendded buyt he author then try to fit int into yoru project. I have seen this with auth alot its hard to get everypeice fit into your ongoing project but you need to confir it works as intended before you spend all the time tryin g ot use it.  SKILL - getting other peopls code to work with yours. Stack overlfow titel seems to be helpful but you have to adapt the working code to your own sitiation . varibale names and so forth. if you can alwasy copy and paste exact code and get working then refactro (defien this ) 

DYNAMIC is the key to everything : what does hardcode mean - static it means that - so DATA FLOW for indiivual itemized dat from large amoutn saray of it dbs fulkl of it .  So the process is ussually to"hack it togheth" wiht hardcoded single use data modeled after the real data.  tehn integrate the data. Get one thing working at a time. MVP for projects. 

Let us repeat this again together: "Errors will be a fact of life."

put int trends area SKILLS: LEGACY CODE UPGRADES  courses etc. Angular 1.5 to 2.0  older Re3act to new stuff - Php to react is proplaur right now or Vue - build same project in diffen langauges - show employers

## Internet/Computer Basics 


COMPUTER knowledge :  Some of this information can seem tedious to pick but it does come in handy and I have talked to many developers who don't fully get all this. I think hte really good ones know this but most don't.  How many ports are there? 65000  - useful to know with server side tech 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type Files types JSON form-data url encoded three I have sen the most 


SKILL: Proficient in Linux/Unix and comfortable with Mac/Windows - taken from a real job psoting for a full stack engineer
OS 
MAC Windows Linux
Which one is best for a devleoper.  Well I think that is dependent on langauge and is subjective really.  The bust produccts are usually availble for all 3.  Mac comes with a better built in terminal bash than Windows and LInux comes pre installed with Python - I have seen on job psoting - experience with LInux as an actual skill, Windows has its own things like microsfot dev suite and you can get what is known as a virtual machine of windows - we may come backk to virtual machines later. Just  knwo the term. and know whatever your preference youo can still code.   some LInux basics - windwos mac in dev set up

## Your First Code and Laying a Programming Foundation
Just a thought for the self-taught (i.e. not obtaining a university degree in CS):

> Learning how to program outside of school is increasingly common. A 2015 Stack Overflow (an online community of programmers) survey found 48 percent of respondents did not have a degree in computer science. -Althoff, Cory. The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally (p. 3). Triangle Connection LLC. Kindle Edition. 

What is programming ? 
> Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute. The instructions might tell the computer to print Hello, World!, scrape data from the Internet, or read the contents of a file and save them to a database. These instructions are called code. 

For an example see this [Harvard CS 50 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUB-aJXquUA) WATCH: 17:45 -25:55. 
Main take away: computers can only do exactly what you tell them to do, no more no less. So learn to be very detailed and specific.

Before writing any code even Harvard kids start out on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) DO: Make a game or spend a few hours on [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn). The main concepts you need to pick up on are statements(commands to the computer), loops(repeat something), conditions(like a fork in the road, if/else), Boolean Expressions(something is either true or false) and more.

After having covered some basic coding concepts you are ready to write real code. You can now jump into learning for free on all of these sites:  Google and YouTube have thousands of tutorials. Here are some pretty good ones:

Warning:https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?language=en
 Be committed - Not one person ever told me coding (also known as programming) was easy 
 Be committed - Like leaning to speak a foriegn language coding requires study and practice and more practice 
 Be committed - It takes time and diligence and consitency lots of struggle and stretching for most  nd
ALWAYS BE CODING - once you learn a few concepts try to use it and play around make a folder called /sandbox and jsut make use of new things there. 
SKILLS: Google Fu  Skill in using search engines (especially Google) to quickly find useful information on the Internet
stack overflow with g - dont need to memorize everythign at first

FULL STACK define 
A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. SO using the definitions above: Full Stack Web Development is writing the instructions for a web browser to interpret in order to render and make work a website on the internet. That includes what is known as back-end and front-end technologies as we learned above the client side and server side.

Start with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). You will need to register (it's free) then click into Web Development and bascially try to lick the top right to go to learn or catalog and start iwth HTML CSS and JavaScript or any language of choice. There are paid portions of the site but you can do a lot for free. The paid stuff includes quizzes and more activities.

## Initial Setup Installing the Basics to Code on your local computer
Your ready to get coding you will need to set up yoru computer. I have used all three and found tutrials to have mixed results. So all iI can say is trial and error. Google one for your set up and good luck. So google HOW TO INSTALL ___ on LInux Mac OS Windows etc.

What advantage does a bootcamp really give over self taught ? Should I do a bootcamp or self teach ?
If there were anyway to convince a person there is no need for a bootcamp I will find it. Imagine this: 1 year experience collecting everything and trying to tell someone everything they learned in bootcamp and full time emploemtn and many horus of googling and many courses and tutorials. All they tell you is to go on stakc overflow and for me - activites have some one or some other student to ask how to do it when sstuck . its the getting unstuck that is priceless with boootcamps.  one aleterntiave is active pteachers and ta  s on udemy and other sites treehouse tehese actually work pretty good but most do not have immediate feedback.

tip  TAB word completion in vs code and terminal or start typing and select from list - hover over something vs code 

“The art of readable code” (Boswell, Foucher). The fundamental theorem of readability : code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it !
Things you can do to imporve your code:
picking good names,(semantic meaningful names)  
writing good comments
formatting your code neatly (clean use of whitespace)

Linting — prevent bugs by not writing wrong code
In development, this is linting. Linters are software that analyses your code while you write it. It executes the partial code in the background and tells you when something is wrong. In the past you needed to install and configure linters yourself. These days, many come as extensions to editors with preconfigured rules. Rules that are the result of years of experts arguing and finding a consensus what makes sense. Google’s developer tools in Chrome give you similar insights. Reading through the results of linters is a good learning exercise. They not only tell you that something is wrong, but also why, what the effects are and how to fix it.

This editor is open source and comes with hundreds of extensions to help you with your tasks. It has linting built-in and allows for setting breakpoints in the editor itself. It contains a command line interface to do more hard-core tasks and has Git version control built in. There is something great about not having to jump from editor to browser to terminal.

### Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.
About me: After writing my first lines of code while taking a basic tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. To do that I became proficient. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter. To make Senior I must become a master at my craft. I set the goal to master my craft within 5 years and to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. 

**This is just a resource I do not claim ownership of anything on here.

##### Skill: Workflow
This is intended to be the first most basic steps> If something is unfamilar ebleive me you will not want to skip over it. I have sat next to a 7 year veteran Senior dev and he did not know some of these keys 
Text Editor (IDE integrated development environment) - VS code is winning the fight according to some sources to be honest my personal opinoin is that overall its the easiet to use and is free. Webstorm is cool but cost moneya and has differnt hot keys and bascially is hard to learn from my epxerience people still using Sublime are jsut "don't want to change old shocoolers" which has its place for peopel that are really good and don't need more or new. If you want to use Sublime, Atom whatever then jsut google how to do all these things in that editor and you will be fine. But they all are great so that would be a worthwhile exericse.
pro tip:
Goal skill: be able to quickly move through all your files (code) find functions variables and their instances 
CTRL is the same as using the command key on Mac
CTRL + A Selects all
CTRL + G Go To a line number
CTRL + C ULTIMATE KEY OF ALL copy surprisingly high nuer of previous non coders dont reallu use this unless really good on a computer right lcik copy is super slow )
CTRL + V Paste 
SHIFT UP ARROW  move the line up or down not sure what this key is yet look it up
CTRL + D (esp useful remember to use Home and End keys to dynamically scroll to end or beginning of the lines text dynamically)
CTRL + ?/ (after selecting a block of code this will comment or uncomment if commented out the whole block or line) 
Save all key bidnings etc config for es lint and js options etc
CTRL + P file name search
CTRl + SHIFT + F find all occurences in all files in workspace
CTRL + Z
CTRL + SHIFT + Z
ALT + UP or ALT +  DOWN moves the current line up or down on the page 
double click on file at top or left and it will have its own window if you don't dot his and click another file without editing it will disappear and the tab be overwrittn. also the text goes italic whne not clicked twice
Code snippets
! tab boilerplate
for example 
<li*  turns into <li 3x etc 
drag the file from the top open status to the terminal and it puts the exact path there useful for ruhnning node etc. 

BOttm right click file type  GO and has al ot of these keys but its ont usuauolyll my first thoguht to go to each tab and go thorugh each one and knowing whtat it does and when to use it. 

GUI for git - bottom left branches and start and plus sign 
conflicts in purpole. 
CTTL + "~" open bottom tray with 4 optiosn . - mulitple terminals  
problems with file on bottom bar

Debugger for Node vs code
breakpoints
conitional breakpoint - freeze at certain number in loop for example hit count then expression .  
launch.json attach
smart step blackboxing not into dependencies my code only 
restart stackframe
column breakpoints on cahined on eline functions 
chrome and node in vs code seemlessly debug back end node and front end two runtimes

AUTH 
[passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql--cms-27537)
karma.js
nightmare.js

% key extentions for VS CODE 
Prettier - use a config as such
open in browser `techer.open-in-browser` - allows you to right click on an html file and load it in the browser
Prettier- Codeformatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
ES lint 
Beautify (says it works for React JSX but NOT that good ) 
Snippets of any language so for example when I type ccc tab it creates the whle component boiler plate in React. 
Jshint
Emmet - code completion and snipppets 
Can turn off temporarily 
 config : file for workspace 

INITIAL SET UP :
INSTALLS 


Terminal (for linus users use Terminator for teh ideal experience APple has similar)
Unix Commands - The termminal is where programmers live GUI are cool and great but you will need to get used to useing this great tool. Growing up all I rmember was run.exe such and such . So Windows or other OS is jsut a GUI for doing this 
command   Description
pwd       
ls
ls -a see hidden files like git 
ls -ll see who owns the file (if it ever errors messages give you that you don't have that permission it may be wise to check what user owns it for example)
cd [dir]
mkdir [dir]
rm
touch
cat
cd ~ home root
fg
killall node 
killall -9 npm
ipaddress stuff 
up key goes to last item and !! also repeats last command (this is very handy) down goes back down the line- Caution CTRL C stops the prcess from working so you have to use the mouse to copy and paste code 


Git HUb or bitbucket 

vim  - sometimes your temrianl will jump to some weird looking screen it could mean you entered into VIM its like a text editor inside the terminal - good for making quick changes and adding commands/code to computer config files etc 
esc : wq

nano 
ctrl x


HTML - code validation W3
Semantic HTML 
list of tags 
markup browser interprets to render the page 

live-server
icons brady stuff
cubernetes

 Getting oriented with Chrome
 Google Dev tools (Also Mozilla )
Copy the entire things by clicking copy outer html 
also can copy the enitre css document in a snese by useing CSS Steal extension and indivually by viewing each itme and its CSS
also you can find some of the JS

click the arrow to inpect an element
see the CSS associated and the classes break down - 
mobile responsive and tablet view 
Network . XHR 
all the images 
scarpers 
source
box model  up and down arrow keys - can manipulate and chage the page how ever you like inclding repalcing images and chanign text 

breakpoints 
console. (front end code only) remember the clear conosle siymbooll and persist logs so you get the logs even when chanign pages which can be useful 

10 Words you need to know well
MVC
IDE
DOM way of representing objects that can be defined via HTML and then later to be able to possibly interact with through a scripting lanague like JavaScript. HTML tags are known as nodes on the DOM. It can be ordered like a family tree chart.  Parents, children, siblings and so forth in a heirarchal order. So a ul would be the parent of the li and if it has 2 li then those are siblings. Decendants is a common word. 

Git or version control
99% of the commands I actually use in dev on the job ( not implying this is what should be or is done by others or even is the best set at all just plainly what I happen to use and sure it will evolve)
git init (creates a folder for git version control .git)
git add .
git commit -m "my message here"
git push 
git stash 
git stash apply
git merge
git reset HEad 
git log
git status
git checkout <brancname>
git checkout -b creates new branch fro one currently on - so use a development branch and each time start a new branch for     each fauter then merge it back to dev. and rebase before pushing 
  some others and linek to books and huge git hub repo of them 
git bisect 
git remote -v 
git pull
git log . see commit number you can reset to a commit and checkout a commit so do it often
git push --set-upstream origin nss-react-edit-billing

PREtiter ES LINT
WARNING PERSONAL SOAP BOX feel free to skip or not :
if you ever heard the joke ... I did from my CTO and Senior and other Junior Devs 2 or 4 spaces so I did some reaserch and top repos use 2 and 4 there are pros and cons to each. My philosophy is that I could careless jsut let the comoaony decide and if you are that person to decide then literally flip a coin casue I really dont't think it matters. But I amy be shot for sayinga s such annd have been yelled at for real. The most important thing is to make sure you use technolgyo or software to do it for you or in my book y0ou are not a real programmer in fact aht is what wwe do is make things besiter autoemated sreamlined by telling computers to do work for us.  I promised myself when I learned about this debate I would never really get in the habit of hitting tab or spacces but when I hit CTRL S (save in your respective IDE ) the work would be done for you.

once you find out where it stopped you can then debug for real.  10 most common erros. 
knowing all variables in play 
checking syntax and spelling (this I have learned is an error mostly made with beginners) good code editors can prevent most of this disodence

"It's the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation." —Andy Hertzfeld

How to actually add something of value  well by living the one rule of coding called abstraction - this is an abstraction into usable pieces just a little more manageable  than W3 schools or Men
## Purpose Statement

If you want to explore learning to code, have been coding a while and want to progress this is the right place. Beginners will greatly benefit, internwedote devs will lily learn some new things, and experts may want to contribute and critique this to help to bet better or maybe even learn something new.  Some times even if you have 5-10 years expeicen you have been pigeon holed and want to learn more. So you may be an expert in some areas and this will help you find new areas to master.
 How can I be of value ?  This is a question you will get answered by doing this read me. These skills are highly desirable in demand and benefit our world. 
#### INTRO 
Tell you everything -literally everything you would learn in a boot camp and then being employed full time as a full stack developer (Javascript dev mainly). Try to share the benefits of a code camp without having to go to one.  If you are goin got one be well prepared for it. Explain what the benefits are. 

Ther have been many efforts to get people coidng sooner - kids and i have read we still cannot fill all th e jobs with properly traned poeple/.  this is a very small attempt to do that - its a guide to entering the tech market as career or even a hobby - are you someone that thinks you can come up with tons of good app ideas and tech ideas entrepanuership well its very expeseinve to build apps 200k story and you shoudl jsut do it yourself and at the very leart in the process meet the right peopel to help you do yoru dreams. 

This article has the goal to be EXTEMELY COMREHENISVE because I have always been a big picture thinker so you likely will need to go over this article many times and to be used as a reference 

First of all I am seeking a position as a Senior Fullstack Engineer aka Web developer/ Sotware Developer. I hope that this process and help from others through this document may lead to helpining me be a MASTER at my craft. If you are considering a coding bootcamp I highly recommend saving this document as it will come in great use to you I guarantee it. If you are studyinig comuter scinece or are curois about antyhitng aforementioned this is the right palce. This is mostly a reference doc with an app to follow eventually. My wish would be that someone find this useful for them becoming a Fullstack Sofftware develloper. Be more direct here and simple with explanation after. Been to 3 bootcamps. 1. Paid Immersive FT 12 hours day for 3 months. 2. udemy past bootcamp teacher made his own course 3. a University Supported Professional Coding Bootcamp. 4. BOoks on holisitc full stack Web develoment:  5. 1 year experince coding and want to make senior in at best 3 years and maximum 7 years. I want to share the relazatively littel iI have learned but wish I knew more of when I started. Eveyrone that reads general psots out there on linked nin or caaeer stuf knows that Websd=veolopment is hot and growing so no better time to start tahn now. After my bootcamp I took some React courses from a great Udemy Pro name Stephen Grider. I also bought a course taught by an ex bootcamp insturctor which was an entire bootcamp on its own from what he took and said it was better than his bootcamp.  Both of these peole claim their students go on to get jobs.  I spent about $120 on about 10 courses. I was so furoius I had jsut soent well over 12000 for a 3 month bootcamp that I was motivated ot help others not have to do that.  DOn't get me wrong I actualy do not regret my expereince and recommend it to anyone needing structure BUT te reason I was mad is that I finally understood that the key beifnte is sommeone explainging to you when you are stuck.  You cannot esaily interact with the udemy professor althoguh the ones I have metninoed are agressive in getting realtivley quick respnsed ot you but even a few hours is costly.   

### Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.
About me: After writing my first lines of code while taking a basic tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. To do that I became proficient. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter. To make Senior I must become a master at my craft. I set the goal to master my craft within 5 years and to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well.

You’re considering a career change but not sure how to take the first step. » You’re happy in your current field, but want to move to another company—or stay put but shift from a non-technical into a technical position. » You want to engage more deeply with your current job—or boost your earnings and broaden your experience with freelance work. » You have an entrepreneurial idea and need to acquire the skills to go “all in” on it and launch your business. » You’re a full-time student but hungry to learn more and expand your skill set.


HOW TO READ THIS DOCS: SKILLS in gray header - taken from a real job psoting for a full stack engineerany paragprah or is askill I have learned on the job or in a bootcamp.  lnger than 2 sentences are bascailly my subjective expereince and thoughts. I only want to share exactly what has been to me as helpful or things i have learned and think can be learned fsater if shared in this format. Be a proficient developer quicker like having a cheat sheet. Also a holistic collection all in one place ehich can be dangerous since it contains so much but I am doing it anyways.Where I have been and help others get there quicker. I have learned a language and now several computer alnguesa =. determination is key.  One thing I have never hear donce is that programming is easy. High paying jobs as it is. Basically this is more like a small book - VOCAB sections. PRO TIPS is just a lesson learned type ofthigins high level overview sometimes and stuff I think is crucial \- I have read many books and contain relatively  similar type of content but my goal is not use words when I don't have to and let others do the talking and you do the googling searching. that way you can find the ost current and select links you think lok good and in the process learn how to use google fu better and read docs  - 2 sentences of what is key information as to why you would google more of it. 


DESIGN OF COURSE clean code first - ESLINT prettier - code snippets - emmet naming conventions - style guide first - like that boot camp that assembly something that said something about clean code. 

Peanut butter jelly stuff 
Algorithms foundation first - make money ! Feasible 
Whiteboarding pseudo code - reading code making pieces on codepen to see it work and play in action. Disect like in medical school.. direct a big app. See the end from the beginning. 
Master the browser

One basic question you could ask your self before you get into the tech industry  and whether or not you fit is to go ahed and look at the giants of today’s tech industry.  What are they looking for ?  I doubt anyone would argue if I worked 5 years at Google 3 years at Apple and 2 years at Microsoft and then finished out my round with a cruel yers at Amazon do you think any other software./tech company ont he lanes would not want to hire that person ? What I am saying is obviously they set the bar so to speak although of course there are plenty of “better”developers that work else where for sure. 
Google. 
There’s no one kind of Googler, so we’re always looking for people who can bring new perspectives and life experiences to our teams. If you’re looking for a place that values your curiosity, passion, and desire to learn, if you’re seeking colleagues who are big thinkers eager to take on fresh challenges as a team, then you’re a future Googler.love of tech help you be a better developer. Creator by knowing essentially the work products of other great developers 
Microsoft 
With technology evolving at a rapid pace, companies face increasing pressure to move faster. To create new capabilities. To deliver more innovative solutions. Microsoft Core Services Engineering is addressing 
Amazon. 
We're a company of pioneers. It's our job to make bold bets, and we get our energy from inventing on behalf of customers. Success is measured against the possible, not the probable.
ach of these groups has different needs, and we always work to meet those needs, by innovating new solutions to make things easier, faster, better, and more cost-effective.

Love of technology . Here is one Podium screen shot. Cable. Tron matrix. If could plug you in that is what this is lie. But I am not gonna lie it’s still  hard work. 

Author hate reading ?  I mean it’s possible to hate tech and still be a good coder this simple gut check not a catch all 

Do the analogy.  Would you be a salesperson. If you absolutely hate being sold something ?  That’s what I did I love people too and tech now I get to do both. Cause really the end user are people. Making t hem happier more making heir lives better 

Read book and articles of people you admire. See if you can find out how they came tod I what they did. It may dawn on yo as it did for me

Bias:  Skill all 3 OS - Google - I  Started using Chrome because it became a better experience for me .  http://thume.ca/2013/05/17/best-search-engine/  - the only point is that I think it is important to note that while in your personal life you may be able o code on any os set up you want and that is fgreat. But being felixibel is willing to learn others is a job skill so my recommendation is that if you want to be a highly desired dev the kind that gets whatever job you want or the best job out there at the best company or even the type to get head hunted then I would make sure that is a skill you have.

There are lots of different paths you can take in your coding career. My goal is become a senior full stack developer. Not always but fulls tack developers are more like a Swiss army knife and since they can pretty much do it all they get paid more. Also  in terms of just being able to launch your own app you need an understanding of all pieces of the puzzle here.

prove in startups to be a Full Stack Developer. Only a few are given freedom for what they do in the beginning stage.  almost the only way unless you have a cs degree and expereinc

If you have gotten this far you have probably decided coding is for you or at least you want to give it a try.  This section covers what the path of a full stack web developer looks like. Javascirpt in specific.  Not all coders end up to be Full stack developers but to have a full understanding : JOB SKILL understand back end etc so  
Senior makes sure it gets deployed
A developer that does the front and and the back end .Together they make up the websites we all know and love. On the front-end (or client-side), you have everything a user sees and interacts with on a webpage. On the back-end (or server-side) you have the server and the database technology that houses the data of your website.

General full stack developers skills ?
Design dev ops design and more
It is always said that being a software developer is a lifelong learning affair. Since the trends and technologies get the expire ticket often in the software field, one should be ready to cope up with a sudden change. It is a continuous treadmill where relaxing is seldom a choice.
Many software development & engineering jobs are flooding the current job market.
Technically speaking it is not a standard set by the industry. It is an evolutionary facet of skills. A full stack developer always tries to learn open source technologies to apply them in his/her job. In my opinion, full stack development is a minimalistic(at least) combination of following things
Front-end Development + Back-end Development + DevOps + Design
Apart from building web applications comfortably, a full stack developer should know how to deploy, optimize, automate the application.
SKIL working in a team and be able to finish tasks in the time.working with other teams busienss maagners product maganer CTO

FULL STACK define 
A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. SO using the definitions above: Full Stack Web Development is writing the instructions for a web browser to interpret in order to render and make work a website on the internet. That includes what is known as back-end and front-end technologies as we learned above the client side and server side.




## Yes I want to learn to code !

that gives you the knowledge and skills to build dynamic end-to-end web applications and become a full stack web developer.
theory and application of web development. As you gain proficiency, you’ll use what you learn on real projects under the guidance of area employers. Plus, you’ll have an impressive Professional Portfolio and the confidence to succeed as a web development professional.BORNE IDENITY picture here no you don’t have to kill anyone its just a attempt to being the commtietn level.

One thing I have noticed about programmers is they are predilection about their tools.  You need to accept one thing now. Hating Microsoft or Apple or Google or Facebook for example is still free to do but as I will show later you Amy have to use all of these tools in the workplace to put all technology prejudice aside and accept that you may end using tech just be open minded so that is not a problem.  I thinks its super lame.  I only use Mac or only use Windows is fine if you are really that picky and get lucky (i.e your employer buys you a new Apple MacBook Pro) but for the most part just forget it all and know that every tool as its pros and cons and you may have to use one you hate.  I was forced to use a Linux setup at my job and have never even barely understood what Linux what before I started cody. Only that I lived with 1 dude in college that used Linus so one out of like 20 roommates but guess what I now have a Mac Linus and windows - and I will later prove that is a job skill to be proficient in all of them. This goes for Code editors and so forth.  Just seek the best tool for the job and put prejudice bejind. There is a place for you but you millet yourself and eventually will miss out on smoothing soloed based on prejudice.  
               ###### Resources for learning 

Essentials - Before gong on you need to create accounts for the following services.  
Codepen 
Github ( sign in and star this article is the first step)
meetup.com
codecademy.com
Google (they have useful tools for developers) and Facebook (also a much needed tool for devs and other things like groups)

Paid 
Codescool
Treehouse 

BOOT CAMP uncovered : 
Coding camps:
Access to a mentor - more interactive lectures time for questions - access to networking with other students experience working in a group , career guidance and possible employer networks ,  job guarantee, ask other struggling to learn students for help , make friends, structure , prepared guided activities and explanations   make a t chart showing alternative 

goal is to get you portfolio pieces and the proficiency to make them  : those that have a job guarantee just learn what they learn and do the required job search criteria and just assume that you will get a job. I know you can do it . But it does take hard work.  video read me lnked in all the stuff I learned for free-not just the code 
I promise you can and will learn all I have after basically 3 boot camps and 1 year coding employed.

If you are going to be great at anything immersion is a great step.  One way to connect with others is to join free meet ups on meet up.com  Really good ones offer free food a lecture on a coding topic relative to the purpose of the group and then coding time or networking.  UtahJS Angular Utah, HackerNest Salt Lake City Tech Socials, ReactJS Utah, Utah Software Craftsmanship, Silicon Slopes Developer Chapter, SLC Tech Startups, Utah Node.js - Salt Lake City, Utah Elm Lunch, Bleeding Edge Web, Utah Internet of Things (IoT), JavaScript Lecture Series. Facebook groups can be great as well.  There are great groups for React JS, React native community, javascirt, Angular, and more.  There are some pages to like that will put stuff in your feed so you can read useful info not what your high school acquaintance or whoever ate for dinner. JS weekly is absolutely one of the best things I ever did on Facebook. When I go to scroll through my feed I see awesome posts about JS stuff many of which I have Rea and gained valuable knowledge from.  
Slack is a great tool as well.  If you have never used this tool its time to start for sure.  Start by 
Medium is a great tool follow the authors that have great articles that you come across - All of this is like having pros that love to help other devs all around you.  The development community is awesome you will see Facebook 
Slack is a newer very powerful way to communicate in real time with new video calling available.  Mostly community users are able to get by with never paying a dime for any of it. The creators of each channel may be playing similar to meet up where the organizer pays but the group goes for free.

Ask a pro pay tons are learn to use online resources.  It takes a bit to transition to learning online just like it can feel weird for some to switch to a n ereader like  kindle or iPad mini etc to read books but can be just as good.  Watch a pro explain what he thinks and can be much more focused - when they are very good they even anticipate your questions so find those type of teachers and you can speed up pause rewind tis great HTML 5 wexnteions 

Social Coding -playgournd sandbox
CodePen 
JsBin, js bucket plink etc 
Replit (perfect for saving just plain JS snippets (and other languages) for reference and having a place to run and test js code. 
Git hub Gist - 
Simba and VS code and websotrm have live coding software like Google docs. 
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/visual-studio-live-share-takes-the-pain-out-of-collaborative-coding/
Like google docs if you have loved google products ike collaborative google docs you would be wondering where is this tech bit for coding well its here but its not yet

Enki - like those brain games but for code 
Laserlike (apple store ) - select all web dev, software type topics to have in feed - there are many apps like this. Basically you find one you ike and add a feed to your news feed and then you open the app and it has a feed. Good for “on the pot”. Waiting in line I have found great articles from using this app.
I constantly know things some of my coworkers don’t know.  Knowledge is power it has been said.

Podcast 
Why you should listen to podcasts
Podcasts are simply radio-style audio shows distributed over the internet, usually for free. They provide an excellent way to consume quality information while performing daily tasks such as commuting, cleaning, or working out.
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-best-podcasts-for-new-coders-and-the-best-tools-for-listening-to-them-df393b1c8dc.  Syntax 
The question you should ask yourself is how good do you want to get and how fast?  Taking advantage of situations as discussed you can learn more code. If you are the type that needs a break then do it but really just commit 1 year with all your might to learning everything you can and that will be a great foundation for your career. But really the learning will never stop. So one sign you are in the right place is if you actually like learning things. Then all this is not a burden

Ways to cultivate a love of technology 
Read tech blogs magazines and more than anything be a user of great tech small and wide. Do you ever wish an app existed. The adage there is an app for that.

Google FU. - tool last month
if you had a senior dev there. what woul.d y9ou ask them itsl iekly been asked before that is the key to find a smilar very simialr queston.  they have all been asked before (99%) lol so if you don;t find one titled wiht a simialr title to your question try reoqrding the quetion just a biut.  make sure to include the langauge and libariary and PRO tip on gogole you can filter the search rewstuls by time so as to not get too old of stuff altough stil can help you .  I gogoel noral first if stuff look too old then do a narrow time search but other people start with most recent then go back which works too I guess. Paid mentors charge big bucks and they are out ther. 
Adding key words to an exact question you would ask a human mentor or teacher. 
Alos one approach is to just cut out filler words like how and the and a etc. 
Inputs with react   to get a general answer and then sift out what you can form there 
Can add filter by date 
If there is one thing they tell you more than anything in a bootcamp is that Googling is basically the most important skill you can learn.  WHY? Cause it is impossible to learn it all and memorize everything.  
Enter sack overflow and many other QA sites like git hub help - I work as a TA at a bootcamp right now and many times I have sat down with a student and had an idea but no real answer to their inquiry for help.  I mean after all they re playing for a guy like me or someone with experience to tell them how to solve their problem that is why they are paying but goes what I don’t have every thing memorized so after I help them solve their problems with I almost always do it s just cause Iknow how to google better not always but the other knowledge I have when I hasnwer there question is stuff Iwl will share in this document as well. So that should cover it. If for some reason you are not using Google as your search engine I pity you and refer back to my earlier challenge to you. Swallow your pride and use the best tool vavailbale you can still be a faithful Microsoft or yahoo fan even though you admit their search engine is not the bets. (  I know I Amy get some hate mail for this). Technically you may be fine but honestly if you are going to DEV (that is the nick name for what you do now. Just use Gogole. Moxxialla also has great features with a fast SJ anginen coming down the pipeline at Elat for searching for answers just use google and I wont tell on you I promise.

## Internet/Computer/OS Basics 

SKills Solid understanding of internet and IP communications protocols and formats such as TCP/IP, HTTP, XML, JSON, etc

The fist question is how does the internet work ? https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm  Be sure to note the resources section for further learning.  if this post from a Stanford University class does not help just Google it for 30 mins on Youtube and infographcs if you prefer. Again everything in here is necesary knwoldeg for a ser=nior fullstack engineer if you want just the basics like preppring for a bootcamp maybe jsut spend 5 minutes on each of the more boring topics liek this one for  aorugh overview or better yet spend horus and don't even go to a bootcamp.

mIT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM. Beginner course intro to cs computer programming 


<a name="Your-First-Code"></a>
## Your First Code and Laying a Programming Foundation
Just a thought for the self-taught (i.e. not obtaining a university degree in CS):

> Learning how to program outside of school is increasingly common. A 2015 Stack Overflow (an online community of programmers) survey found 48 percent of respondents did not have a degree in computer science. -Althoff, Cory. The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally (p. 3). Triangle Connection LLC. Kindle Edition. 

What is programming ? 
> Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute. The instructions might tell the computer to print Hello, World!, scrape data from the Internet, or read the contents of a file and save them to a database. These instructions are called code. 

For an example see this [Harvard CS 50 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUB-aJXquUA) WATCH: 17:45 -25:55. 
Main take away: computers can only do exactly what you tell them to do, no more no less. So learn to be very detailed and specific.

Before writing any code even Harvard kids start out on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) DO: Make a game or spend a few hours on [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn). The main concepts you need to pick up on are statements(commands to the computer), loops(repeat something), conditions(like a fork in the road, if/else), Boolean Expressions(something is either true or false) and more.

After having covered some basic coding concepts you are ready to write real code. You can now jump into learning for free on all of these sites:  Google and YouTube have thousands of tutorials. Here are some pretty good ones:

Warning:https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?language=en
 Be committed - Not one person ever told me coding (also known as programming) was easy 
 Be committed - Like leaning to speak a foriegn language coding requires study and practice and more practice 
 Be committed - It takes time and diligence and consitency lots of struggle and stretching for most  nd
ALWAYS BE CODING - once you learn a few concepts try to use it and play around make a folder called /sandbox and jsut make use of new things there. 
SKILLS: Google Fu  Skill in using search engines (especially Google) to quickly find useful information on the Internet
stack overflow with g - dont need to memorize everythign at first

READING CODE = if you know the vaculary and function  is very useful  so study for HTLM cool website jsut pull up google chrome and read the code. study it - if anything seems new google it and note it down copy and paste it in to a ongoing sandbox folder. 
READ ME TUROIALS - KEY IF the tutiral is well done it will work but iwth almost all cases code is exact so instaead of trying to make someting work form jsut reading it - alwasy clone the whole repo and get it working on your set up perfectly as intendded buyt he author then try to fit int into yoru project. I have seen this with auth alot its hard to get everypeice fit into your ongoing project but you need to confir it works as intended before you spend all the time tryin g ot use it.  SKILL - getting other peopls code to work with yours. Stack overlfow titel seems to be helpful but you have to adapt the working code to your own sitiation . varibale names and so forth. if you can alwasy copy and paste exact code and get working then refactro (defien this ) 
DOCS readings- the first several times looking at DOCS you are very bored and have a hard time udnersating super easily what is going on .  YOu will grow to love people who have good docs like react or express. Jquery.  Some docs make you wan to cry 
copy pasting snipepts of code and making sense and use of it. code is exact if you don't tell it ecalty and get everyithgn it will break and does often. 

SKILLS: writting celan mainaltabel sacaleb code. 



## Initial Setup Installing the Basics to Code on your local computer
Your ready to get coding you will need to set up yoru computer. I have used all three and found tutrials to have mixed results. So all iI can say is trial and error. Google one for your set up and good luck. So google HOW TO INSTALL ___ on LInux Mac OS Windows etc.

Where and how can I learn how to code. Short answer: Online almost entirely for free. Hopefully you already knew that and found this README in hope to find good ways to learn online for free.
What advantage does a bootcamp really give over self taught ? Should I do a bootcamp or self teach ?
If there were anyway to convince a person there is no need for a bootcamp I will find it. Imagine this: 1 year experience collecting everything and trying to tell someone everything they learned in bootcamp and full time emploemtn and many horus of googling and many courses and tutorials. All they tell you is to go on stakc overflow and for me - activites have some one or some other student to ask how to do it when sstuck . its the getting unstuck that is priceless with boootcamps.  one aleterntiave is active pteachers and ta  s on udemy and other sites treehouse tehese actually work pretty good but most do not have immediate feedback.

Enter Mongoose.
	•	Mongoose lets us define models for our Mongo data. No surprise data types for particular fields.
	•	We can set required fields, too.
	•	We can create custom functions to handle our data in ways that aren't already baked in Mongoose.
	•	What's more, we can combine collections with "populate," a method that offers very similar functionality to a MySQL join.
By default, mongoose uses callback functions to handle what happens after performing a query. By setting a mongoose.Promise to the promise library built into node, we're telling mongoose that we'd like to use promises instead. This cleaner, more powerful syntax will actually make our mongoose queries resemble queries we've made with sequelize.Be sure to tell students that if they need really advanced relations, MySQL may still be the better choice.

What is "Linting"?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting
Parsing syntax analysis or syntactic analysis is the process of analysing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The term parsing comes from Latin pars (orationis), meaning part (of speech).

Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. The term may also be used to describe a split or separation.

Operating Systems and Berkley 
http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp14/
The Summery of the List is as follows:
1. Mastering the foundation. You have been through an introduction to CS course, like the ones from Coursera or Udacity.
2. Learn at least one object-oriented programming language. Like Java, C++, or Python. Consult Udacity or MIT.
3. Learn other programming languages. Add CSS, Ruby, Java Script, and HTML to your skillset. CodeAcademy and W3school are places you might want to visit.
4. Test your code. Companies like Google wants you to be able to “Find bugs, create tests, and break your software.” Udacity, again.
5. Get some background in abstract math. It is math like logical reasoning and discrete math, on which lots of computer science depends upon. MIT can help you with mathematics courses for computer science.

6. Understand data structures and algorithms . Companies like Google wants you to learn about fundamental data types like queues, stacks, and bags, as well as grasp sorting algorithms like mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort. MIT provides the recommended online resources.
7. Know operating systems. Because they are the places where you do most of your work at. The University of California, Berkeley,provides a primer in this course.
8. Become familiar with Artificial Intelligence. Google loves AI and robots. Stanford provides the knowledge.
9. Learn to build compilers. According to Stanford, by learning to build compilers,  “you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines.” Head to Coursera for the learning.
10. Learn cryptography. Because cybersecurity is a very crucial part.Udacity and Coursera provide courses.
11. Learn parallel programming. Because being able to carry out tons of computations at the same time is super powerful. The University of Illinois can help you out.
Here is the Link Google shared. link.

BEST MONEY SPENT|
Udemy STEPHEN GRIDER  10-19 incognito total 80-90. https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/ 16 courses if you get them all at 10 that is only $160 and that is money well spent trust me having competed =several of his courses and purchased and started about 8 of them.  React course and React native. And mongo esp.  even one on coding technical interviews and go lang. The reason he is so good is that he anticipates your questions quite well and has a standing principle that he will never let you see him 1 single line of code that he does not thourglhly explain. I can safely say I would not be where I am without his course on Fulls tack react and Node. I am in fact a mere developer as taught in the video and I cant say for sure but it may be the few personal fullstack projects that I built after watching his videos that my current employer saw on my protilfio site.   He also covers very up to date and relevant stuff and useful stuff that is commonly used and normally tough to do like auth and redux and so forth.  

 lynda.com (https://www.lynda.com/signup?lpk35=9137) 19.99 or 29.99 (with no activities but yes on quizzes see above link) - https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Web/become-a-full-stack-web-developer. its a ton of content but after watching tons and being through all these bootcamps Ic an safely say it is pretty darn thorough and quite good . web dev path and list of courses - pretty thorough  30 days free trial and also likely another 30 days through linked in learning which is that same content difference platform 
So that is enough time to watch on 2x or 1.5, 1.75 speed 


Treehouse ES6 course small video and quizzes 
Try it free for 7 days then $25/mo. thereafter
https://teamtreehouse.com/join/start-trial?utm_source=google&cid=1027&utm_source=google&campaign=846901888&utm_term=&cid=1027&gclid=EAIaIQobChMImNDOv6Pq2AIVUIJ-Ch3Z4gKzEAAYASAAEgL-__D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds quizzes and shorter videos 

Front end masters - many courses on react due vscode (expensive but pretty good workshops styles ) (https://frontendmasters.com/) $39 month the most expensive one I have sene BUT its that much for a reason these are pros and masters and teach in a cool workshop style with handling questions and all with the most up to date relevant stuff like VS code Vue React Redux and much more. So buy 2-3 months worth if you are taking your time or pound out a couple courses in a month would be well worth it on the topic of your choice.
 
UDMEY bootcamp clot Steele 
 (very subjective and biased towards react developers but legit ) the of course after watching it I was able to feel proficient in react and it took lots of googling but was able to build a commercially used enterprise app for fortune 500 company from the foundations learned in these courses and bootcamp - 
https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/ this course is very near to the Stephen grider level.  Agin the power of these course is that they walk through an entire project with you line by line with detailed exmapalitons and are both good about reasoning to their students in the QA and sections . I t may not be real time but they do get back to you and usually you can read others that had smiler issues too so be sure to read those first. He has 2 bootcamp courses I have only taken the older one not the so called “advaced one” but I would bet its even better. And all those I have mentioned have about a 4.7 overall with over 350000 students enrolled between he two of them. Where as Stephen is great for React and node and mongo this course is more like a typical bootcamp with jQuery HTML CSS and all the typical stuff in a bootcamp after all he was a past bootcamp instructor. 

Another total all star is wes bos he does the javacsiptr in 30 days free content and more and his courses are popular as well I just happened to not need to go through them due to stpehn girder s http://wesbos.com/.  Also has a free youtube channel and syntax podcast 
Andrew mead is also good for react

Computer Science and Electrical Engineering are deeply interrelated disciplines, and numerous faculty members are jointly appointed in the two departments at Stanford.

Why CS knowledge ?
These days most important web pages have database access, active response, and other “programming” that take them a whole level beyond the static web pages of the past.
but having a good solid base of computer science knowledge would seem to be a big edge for learning the new technologies.

One of the best things about JavaScript for you as a developer or a website owner is that this is one of the few programming languages that are accepted and supported by all the major browsers without the need of any compilers or plug-ins.
It was developed by Netscape and borrows a lot of its syntax from C language. JavaScript is used very widely and effectively in creating desktop applications as well as for developing games.
It has some 24 million users in 200 countries who are working in 337 different programming languages. Those users include employees from some of the biggest tech companies, including Apple, Google, and Facebook. They all rely on GitHub for spreading their open source software to the world.Web Development 101

Author hate reading ?  I mean it’s possible to hate tech and still be a good coder this simple gut check not a catch all 

Do the analogy.  Would you be a salesperson. If you absolutely hate being sold something ?  That’s what I did I love people too and tech now I get to do both. Cause really the end user are people. Making t hem happier more making heir lives better

So what was the most important factor contributing to a team's effectiveness?

It was psychological safety.

Simply put, psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of taking a risk, and the response his or her teammates will have to taking that risk.

SCRUM AGILE LEAN DEVLOPEMTN Google describes it this way:

In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.
In other words, great teams thrive on trust.

The Bourne ultimatum
Making a checklist before employment
At the very end of my book. 

39$ for three months 
29$ for 2 months 
2 30 trials. 
2 7 days trials or 1 10 /1 7 
Udemy courses buy all at the same time so you get the 10$ cause that goes up later. Even if 15
50-80 

Commitment. To all the principles in here and willingness to live or relocate to a tech hot spot for jobs. I can’t guarantee you a job but I can tell you it’s very likely that you will be hired at a wage of 45-80$ some may even make the coveted 100$k if in San Francisco or NY. 

Even if you work full time of you make the commitment to code learn 3-5 hours per day 6 days a week or more the in 5-7 months you can be ready for full time employment. At least a junior level 

Skill. Adapting other code to yours off stack overflow and js bin etc. make sure to book mark for later use. I have a silver mg problem folder. This habit can help you hone in and track what kinds of problems can be solved off stack overflow. Put down 5 code pen examples and 5 git hub boiler plate examples 5 stack overflow with how o got there or something. And make sure to read comments. Sections and with tutorials go tot he very bottom or check at top for git hub repo so you can clone. Clone all this stuff get it working on your machine. You will notice that can be tricky at times. So it takes practice to get through errors and you start to learn how to cope with the errors   Sandbox. 3 website clones.

WHY whould I and is it fo rme? 
)*Avitivy One: Pick your top 10 companies you would work for.*  Gettting expereince at a lower tier company will help you get there.  Search those out on linked in for peoplpe that have those jobs in your 1st, 2nd or 3rd degree connections (go sign up now and add everuonen you know if you have not yet). Connect with them WITH a message for sure sayinig something easy going like whats it liek to work ther. INtorduce yourself aned say you'd love to connec ton linked in . Develop as many realtionship s as you can to widen you r network. Statistics for for getting a job due to netowrking "someone you know" is claimed to be the easiet or best way to get a job.  I have had little success with this but it has worked once. After selecting your 10 cmpanes reaching out to as many of the emplyees there as possible Sneior, jr. reecurieter,, maanger CTO anyone closly related to the job ando could help out.  I have found hiringn maangers names this way and then reached out to them on ilnkedd in etc. ANything helps in this regard. Even geteting interviews. The essentials include smart, passion for tech and a fierce creative porblem sover and team palyer. You cannot build great apps alone. like tech and computers. I would never count yourself out for age or past ecuation and experince. You now need to copy and paste all those job postings and see the common requiremetnes - the major ones. There is so much variety out ther you can NEVER know everything so accept that now.  Mainly knowing the core langauges and libraires are the key along with good problems solving skils and some other key skills. But is revloved around a languge. You specialize in a certain lanague or langauge set or even kow a few and become a master at a few. In the case of a full stack developer there are tons of lanauge. Right now I am a Javasciprt engieer who specailized in React Redux. and Node. with Mern known as a mern stack developer. So picking a tech stack you wantot specialize in the the first step.  Computer science knoweldge and technical challnege prowess and some sosft skills and culture fit assenstemten. This process is also known as "beginning with teh end in mind."  Also Knowing why and what you want is key in goal setting and life success. education level required: | B.S. Computer Science or equivalent experience 
Major/Field of study: | Computer Science or related field | Years: Minimum 5 years 
If youo are a CS major or grad. I am jealous I never thought about it in college for soem reaosn but did dabble with some free classes on app developmetn but Standfor Univierty. This documetn may help you if yu plan on going into Full Stack Web developerment or Javascirpt Enginner.  Those graduating in an realted filed Kudos to you you will have alsightly easier time finding a job on a relative scale form what I have seen. FOr the rest of us. we have to go off of Equivalent Experience.
So ainly teh main purpose of this docs is to learn more about what I have foudn off of real job postings and and cpmapre contracst with teh 1 year exp and needs I haveseen there and 4 bootcamps

what can a person with this skill do find 5 examples.  

Knows how to deploy his/her code on AWS EC2 with Apache2 or Nginx as a web server. Should have a working knowledge of Docker and Virtualization.

https://www.justinmind.com/blog/online-ux-ui-courses-to-take-now-10-best-free-and-paid/
Can design a web application end to end with many loosely coupled components. Should be brave enough to suggest the architectural changes if he has a valid reasoning to do so.

*SKILLs: Proficient in Linux/Unix and comfortable with Mac/Windows* - 
OS 
MAC Windows Linux
Which one is best for a devleoper.  Well I think that is dependent on langauge and is subjective really.  The bust produccts are usually availble for all 3.  Mac comes with a better built in terminal bash than Windows and LInux comes pre installed with Python - I have seen on job psoting - experience with LInux as an actual skill, Windows has its own things like microsfot dev suite and you can get what is known as a virtual machine of windows - we may come backk to virtual machines later. Just  knwo the term. and know whatever your preference youo can still code.   some LInux basics - windwos mac in dev 
Fe thinigs to know. the command key is usually interchagnelable with the CTRL key on Windows and linux keyboards
LInux does not have a click install and is mostly run from the terminal - red hat stuff
LInus is free and 
*VOCAB: open source* 
some basic commands run in the termial 

sudo update
sudo chown -R pmurff:pmurff Security.js
sudo apt install
Sudo chmod a+x filepath  turns into execetuable 
Sudo ./filepath

aadvanced conpcets
Bash rc file
export ports etc

tip  TAB word completion in vs code and terminal or start typing and select from list - hover over something vs code 

“The art of readable code” (Boswell, Foucher). The fundamental theorem of readability : code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it !
Things you can do to imporve your code:
picking good names,(semantic meaningful names)  
writing good comments
formatting your code neatly (clean use of whitespace)

Linting — prevent bugs by not writing wrong code
In development, this is linting. Linters are software that analyses your code while you write it. It executes the partial code in the background and tells you when something is wrong. In the past you needed to install and configure linters yourself. These days, many come as extensions to editors with preconfigured rules. Rules that are the result of years of experts arguing and finding a consensus what makes sense. Google’s developer tools in Chrome give you similar insights. Reading through the results of linters is a good learning exercise. They not only tell you that something is wrong, but also why, what the effects are and how to fix it.

This editor is open source and comes with hundreds of extensions to help you with your tasks. It has linting built-in and allows for setting breakpoints in the editor itself. It contains a command line interface to do more hard-core tasks and has Git version control built in. There is something great about not having to jump from editor to browser to terminal.

Top 5 hot keys to know 
Terminal shell command line
SIDE NOTE : EMACS VIM for remote server access to file and edit etc ENANO?
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/
2. Git https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
I made a super cool list of git commands but dont know where ...basics

This is intended to be the first most basic steps> If something is unfamilar ebleive me you will not want to skip over it. I have sat next to a 7 year veteran Senior dev and he did not know some of these keys 
Text Editor (IDE integrated development environment) - VS code is winning the fight according to some sources to be honest my personal opinoin is that overall its the easiet to use and is free. Webstorm is cool but cost moneya and has differnt hot keys and bascially is hard to learn from my epxerience people still using Sublime are jsut "don't want to change old shocoolers" which has its place for peopel that are really good and don't need more or new. If you want to use Sublime, Atom whatever then jsut google how to do all these things in that editor and you will be fine. But they all are great so that would be a worthwhile exericse.
pro tip:
Goal skill: be able to quickly move through all your files (code) find functions variables and their instances 
CTRL is the same as using the command key on Mac
CTRL + A Selects all
CTRL + G Go To a line number
CTRL + C ULTIMATE KEY OF ALL copy surprisingly high nuer of previous non coders dont reallu use this unless really good on a computer right lcik copy is super slow )
CTRL + V Paste 
SHIFT UP ARROW  move the line up or down not sure what this key is yet look it up
CTRL + D (esp useful remember to use Home and End keys to dynamically scroll to end or beginning of the lines text dynamically)
CTRL + ?/ (after selecting a block of code this will comment or uncomment if commented out the whole block or line) 
Save all key bidnings etc config for es lint and js options etc
CTRL + P file name search
CTRl + SHIFT + F find all occurences in all files in workspace
CTRL + Z
CTRL + SHIFT + Z
ALT + UP or ALT +  DOWN moves the current line up or down on the page 
double click on file at top or left and it will have its own window if you don't dot his and click another file without editing it will disappear and the tab be overwrittn. also the text goes italic whne not clicked twice
Code snippets
! tab boilerplate
for example 
<li*  turns into <li 3x etc 
drag the file from the top open status to the terminal and it puts the exact path there useful for ruhnning node etc. 
https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf
Warning with the git version control GUI and also code shortcut snippets. You should actually be able to do it all on your own first. That is the risk of starting with the goodies you can miss out on the basics. Interviewers can stump you if you depend fully on that stuff. So be versatile. Try other code editors to just see etc. 

BOttm right click file type  GO and has al ot of these keys but its ont usuauolyll my first thoguht to go to each tab and go thorugh each one and knowing whtat it does and when to use it. 

GUI for git - bottom left branches and start and plus sign 
conflicts in purpole. 
CTTL + "~" open bottom tray with 4 optiosn . - mulitple terminals  
problems with file on bottom bar

Debugger for Node vs code
breakpoints
conitional breakpoint - freeze at certain number in loop for example hit count then expression .  
launch.json attach
smart step blackboxing not into dependencies my code only 
restart stackframe
column breakpoints on cahined on eline functions 
chrome and node in vs code seemlessly debug back end node and front end two runtimes

AUTH 
[passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql--cms-27537)
karma.js
nightmare.js

% key extentions for VS CODE 
Prettier - use a config as such
open in browser `techer.open-in-browser` - allows you to right click on an html file and load it in the browser
Prettier- Codeformatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
ES lint 
Beautify (says it works for React JSX but NOT that good ) 
Snippets of any language so for example when I type ccc tab it creates the whle component boiler plate in React. 
Jshint
Emmet - code completion and snipppets 
Can turn off temporarily 
 config : file for workspace 

INITIAL SET UP :
INSTALLS 


Terminal (for linus users use Terminator for teh ideal experience APple has similar)
Unix Commands - The termminal is where programmers live GUI are cool and great but you will need to get used to useing this great tool. Growing up all I rmember was run.exe such and such . So Windows or other OS is jsut a GUI for doing this 
command   Description
pwd       
ls
ls -a see hidden files like git 
ls -ll see who owns the file (if it ever errors messages give you that you don't have that permission it may be wise to check what user owns it for example)
cd [dir]
mkdir [dir]
rm
touch
cat
cd ~ home root
fg
killall node 
killall -9 npm
ipaddress stuff 
up key goes to last item and !! also repeats last command (this is very handy) down goes back down the line- Caution CTRL C stops the prcess from working so you have to use the mouse to copy and paste code 


Git HUb or bitbucket 

vim  - sometimes your temrianl will jump to some weird looking screen it could mean you entered into VIM its like a text editor inside the terminal - good for making quick changes and adding commands/code to computer config files etc 
esc : wq

nano 
ctrl x


HTML - code validation W3
Semantic HTML 
list of tags 
markup browser interprets to render the page 

live-server
icons brady stuff
cubernetes

 Getting oriented with Chrome
 Google Dev tools (Also Mozilla )
Copy the entire things by clicking copy outer html 
also can copy the enitre css document in a snese by useing CSS Steal extension and indivually by viewing each itme and its CSS
also you can find some of the JS

click the arrow to inpect an element
see the CSS associated and the classes break down - 
mobile responsive and tablet view 
Network . XHR 
all the images 
scarpers 
source
box model  up and down arrow keys - can manipulate and chage the page how ever you like inclding repalcing images and chanign text 

breakpoints 
console. (front end code only) remember the clear conosle siymbooll and persist logs so you get the logs even when chanign pages which can be useful 

10 Words you need to know well
MVC
IDE
DOM way of representing objects that can be defined via HTML and then later to be able to possibly interact with through a scripting lanague like JavaScript. HTML tags are known as nodes on the DOM. It can be ordered like a family tree chart.  Parents, children, siblings and so forth in a hierarchal order. So a ul would be the parent of the li and if it has 2 li then those are siblings. Descendants is a common word.  Link to quizlet for fish cards 

Git or version control
99% of the commands I actually use in dev on the job ( not implying this is what should be or is done by others or even is the best set at all just plainly what I happen to use and sure it will evolve)
git init (creates a folder for git version control .git)
git add .
git commit -m "my message here"
git push 
git stash 
git stash apply
git merge
git reset HEad 
git log
git status
git checkout <brancname>
git checkout -b creates new branch fro one currently on - so use a development branch and each time start a new branch for     each fauter then merge it back to dev. and rebase before pushing 
  some others and linek to books and huge git hub repo of them 
git bisect 
git remote -v 
git pull
git log . see commit number you can reset to a commit and checkout a commit so do it often
git push --set-upstream origin nss-react-edit-billing
GIT PRO book git reset head rest url - git bisecct


PREtiter ES LINT
WARNING PERSONAL SOAP BOX feel free to skip or not :
if you ever heard the joke ... I did from my CTO and Senior and other Junior Devs 2 or 4 spaces so I did some reaserch and top repos use 2 and 4 there are pros and cons to each. My philosophy is that I could careless jsut let the comoaony decide and if you are that person to decide then literally flip a coin casue I really dont't think it matters. But I amy be shot for sayinga s such annd have been yelled at for real. The most important thing is to make sure you use technolgyo or software to do it for you or in my book y0ou are not a real programmer in fact aht is what wwe do is make things besiter autoemated sreamlined by telling computers to do work for us.  I promised myself when I learned about this debate I would never really get in the habit of hitting tab or spaces but when I hit CTRL S (save in your respective IDE ) the work would be done for you.

Most of all having fun while coidng is key. Any career guru would tell you taht and hapness specialist. If you hate code obviosly move on if not thoguht try thinking of 10 things you wish you could make or wished existed in tech and it can exicte you. 
Laser like. Or something similar 


Google FU 
Ctrl D in webstorm select multiple cursors. 
Force semi colon. 
Type checking 
Force spacing 
Key argument here is what some call writing legible code. 

Varabile names are descriptive. Functions camel case 
Pick a style and stick to it and likely have to use a company stander so look at these two reps to get and idea of how that is and know how to dial in the tools to automate what you can 

Mini style guides. 
Dear aspiring programmer I am someone who loves to share and help others learn what I have learned in college my favorite professor made dvd of all his lectures.  Then when I labeled react I fell in love with Stephen Grider who is would say is like that odorless in college. Ia m making my own boxes some day of topics I love until then I have this to share.   

Free tests from plural sight. 


They say if you really want to learn something teach it. 
Coders manifest. 
Draw your ideas out and share them with close associates/friends.

Statically typed languages
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is (e.g.: Java, C, C++); other languages offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin)
The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference). Example: Perl, Ruby, Python
Most scripting languages have this feature as there is no compiler to do static type-checking anyway, but you may find yourself searching for a bug that is due to the interpreter misinterpreting the type of a variable. Luckily, scripts tend to be small so bugs have not so many places to hide.
Most dynamically typed languages do allow you to provide type information, but do not require it. One language that is currently being developed, Rascal, takes a hybrid approach allowing dynamic typing within functions but enforcing static typing for the function signature.

I want to build a project to make all of this at the simple- complex levels - what if I had 10 examples of each - the admin tool I just found has all the basics too
Make the whole bootcamp based on being able to build all of these pieces. Only learn a concept with real thing like Uof U has really good stuff but there are different ways to do it need to show that.

The minimum major in computer science consists of 96 units, including 26 units of math, 11 units of science, 13 units of engineering fundamentals, one course in TIS (Technology in Society), and 43 units of core depth. After learning essential programming techniques in CS106 (via the CS106A/B/X courses) and the mathematical foundations of computer science in CS103, the computer science major offers coursework in areas such as artificial intelligence, biocomputation, computer engineering, graphics, human-computer interaction, information, systems, and theory.

I bet with google you can learn all you need to form any of these courses maybe friends you know that are cs grad have repos on one for you to check out copy

 5tips for senior dev
Its all about clean code and code that can be easily understood and as Kyle Simpson has said  “any fool can write code a computer can understand ; good programmers write code that humans can understand”
1. Be Simple
It’s one of our core values at BT! We try our best to deliver a Personal, Simple and Brilliant experience to all. We have made great efforts in doing this with all the services we provide and we continue to work towards being as simple as possible! Aristos says “As a Senior Developer, I write code that is easy for other developers to understand, creating code that is modular and is easy to be maintained and improved.”
 
2. Be Flexible
As one of the biggest Tech companies, we have to be flexible to ensure we can adapt to new systems! Aristos says “I use agile techniques to be able to adapt to the emerging Web Technology”
 
3. Be Curious
We are always looking for ways that can help us improve and value feedback from our customers and employees, we take this on board and put it into action! Aristos says “Always look for solutions that could help us improve.”
 
4. Invest in your skills
Here at BT, we invest in our people and there are many brilliant stories of people who have joined the company as an Apprentice or Graduate and worked their way up the ranks to senior position with the company. Aristos says “Use your time wisely, attend meetups, conferences, be one with the tech community”
 
5. Be Active
We have onsite gym facilities in some of our offices and this can be a great way to refresh your thinking. Take advantage of these opportunities to perform better. - Look after yourself and make sure you use the time you spend in front of your computer wisely. Make sure you keep your body fit as you do the same with your body.

JS Q
Give an example of a time that you used Prototypal OO in JavaScript.
A
Prototypal OO is the other major programming paradigm that really lets JavaScript shine—objects linked to other objects (OLOO). You’re looking for knowledge of when and where to use prototypes, liberal use of “Object.assign()” or mixins, and a solid grasp of concepts like delegation and concatenative inheritance.

Ok, but how do I get the code to tell a story, exactly?
	•	Assemble your solution from small, single-purpose functions that have no side effects.
	•	Aim for a simple, clear flow of data from small function to small function.
	•	Think in terms of inputs and outputs at every level of your system. Each small function transforms its input into an output.
	•	Use precise, self-describing names for your functions and variables.
	•	Functions in particular should be named "verbObject", like renderList or calculateAverage. This emphasizes the transformation of input into output.

In this course, we'll first set up all the tools we need, we'll explore testing with Jess, and we'll run some example tests, create a snapshot, and do coverage reports. Next, we'll go over the Chrome and React DevTools and how we can find the source of our bugs and resolve them. Finally, we'll improve code syntax, bug prevention, and performance, by using type checking, ESLint, and our DevTools. So, if you're ready to exterminate these annoying bugs, open your favorite text editor and let's get started.

The second part of the course is focused on design.
Before you can do design, you have to master a bunch of techniques for analyzing algorithms.
And then you'll be in a position to design algorithms that you can analyze and that which are efficient.
The analysis of algorithm is the theoretical study -- -- of computer program performance -- -- and resource usage. And a particular focus on performance. We're studying how to make things fast. In particular, computer programs. We also will discover and talk about other resources such as communication, such as memory, whether RAM memory or disk memory. There are other resources that we may care about, but predominantly we focus on performance. Because this is a course about performance, I like to put things in perspective a little bit by starting out and asking, in programming, what is more important than performance?

Operatiors gotch Loose equality using ==
Loose equality compares two values for equality, after converting both values to a common type.  After conversions (one or both sides may undergo conversions), the final equality comparison is performed exactly as === performs it.  Loose equality is symmetric: A == B always has identical semantics to B == A for any values of A and B (except for the order of applied conversions).

# Help I am Stuck: A quick guide to help beginner programmers get unstuck?
Purpose: This document is intended to be an aid to you in the first 6 - 12 mon. of your coding career to help develop some habits that will make you an independent problem sovling developer.  

## **KEY attitude 1**
- Learning takes humility.

A humble learner is the readiest learner. Naturally if you are stuck you will be getting feedback. Understand and accept that you will make mistakes. The point is to find them early, before they make it into production. Fortunately, except for the few of us developing rocket guidance software at a place like DragonX or NASA, mistakes are rarely fatal in our industry, so we can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on. You are not your code. Also remember to treat others as you would be treated with feedback. Critique code instead of people-be kind to the coder, not to the code. It was hard for me at first to take critical feedback - I felt defensive - don't do that. It's just code it's not you.

## **KEY attitude 2**
- Learning to code is very hard thus learning to code/program [web dev] takes patience and determination.

You can never learn everything at once, NEO in the Matrix could do stuff like that BUT we have not left the MATRIX ... Just kidding. Sometimes you will stare at code for hours and that is not necessarily okay but is reality. Like learning any new language fluency is not usually easy or super fast. 

"Put in the Hard Hours, at Least 20 Hours, outside of class. According to author Malcolm Gladwell, successful people put in a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate effort to master their craft. As newcomers to the field of web development, be ready to put in your share of hours. While the bare minimum to survive this program is 10 hours of outside class time, we've consistently found that those most successful put in closer to 20 hours of outside effort per week. At times, this number might even need to go upwards of 30 or 40 hours per week during more challenging topics. Simply said, there is no substitute for long, hard hours." (see pre work)

## SKILLS/HABITS to develop for getting UNSTUCK and just being a good programmer!
1. Debugging
2. Google-FU aka Googling
3. Thinking Like a Programmer
4. Getting Outside Help
5. Mastering Workflow Tools Better & General Tips
6. Learning How to Learn [for Mastery]

#### **Skill 1: Debugging (Fullstack JS Web Dev Style)** 
At times, it might even feel like fixing an issue is taking 3–4 times as long as conceiving the original solution. Know in advance that this is completely normal. For novices and experts alike, fixing code is often the most time-consuming task of all. Instead of seeing these spent hours as a distraction, learn to see them as a critical part of the learning process. Each bug you pursue is a lengthy lesson that adds to your arsenal of understanding. Also it is an employable skill I have seen many times on job postings and know many interviewers use broken code to test your skills on.

###### Debugging Overview
A. Write CLEAN code aka just don't write bugs 
B. Ahhh BUG! Where? What? When? Why? How[to fix]? - Error knowledge
C. HTML - Common issues for NOOBS
D. CSS - Common issues for NOOBS
E. JavaScript - Common Errors Checklist for NOOBS
F. General Libraries and Frameworks Troubleshooting Tips 

####### A. Write CLEAN code aka just don't write bugs
- "Precursor to a BUG" Yeah I said it : Writing Cleaner More Efficient Maintainable Code  It has been said this is the key to squashing bugs in our code just don't' write bugs in the first place. Much has been said about this as a precursor to debugging so that in the future you will have less bugs. It should be your goal to CARE about your code. Furthermore, many a job posting has the required skill of Write Cleaner Code and avoid bugs. It was said in a recent retrospective of a group of university bootcamp students that they wished they wished they had focused more on things like code style/conventions which would have led to less confusion which in this case is from a group working on the same project. To fully support this we read in "The Art of Readable Code” by Boswell&Foucher,  "The fundamental theorem of readability : code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it !" I paraphrase further advice from the book: Things you can do to improve your code: picking good names,(semantic meaningful names for variables, functions etc) writing good comments, formatting your code neatly (clean use of whitespace). 

Clean maintainable code - Coming from a non technical background where I thought everything should be automated and why are we using terminal not GUI etc for me especially writing well spaced code was so annoying and I was by habit a sloppy writer. 2 spaces or 4 naming conventions for variables and functions. feed back from other cohorts is hat they wish they knew this stuff before Just start good habits early and be very CLEan in all your code I promise it will pay off. " write code for OTHERS to come then read it"
DRY - if you ever fin yourself repeating code even twice you may need to refactor and generalize and do something better 
after you have exhausted the checklist you are ready to Google it - trust me that list helps Google ain’t going to solve your typos BUT it might tell you someone else had a typo and then fixed their typos to fix said error. so either way it gets done. So onto Google. Continued below... 

Handy tools for helping with syntax and so forth 
JS hint http://jshint.com/
JSON pretty print - pasting huge JSON objects like when console logging a response obj from an API call or what have you and being able to actually see it. also console.table is good too. 
CSS lint
HTML validator 
NOTE: Linting code is a topic for later discussion once you have good habits for writing clean code. ESLint/Prettier/Beautify tools for JS can check and fix syntax errors but if you don't learn on your own first it will always be a crutch and you may get caught in a pickle someday do use linters like ES lint later after like 4 months or so. Preventing BUGS is also related to testing code but will not be covered in this DOCS. 
VS code has tons of extensions :I fyou soley rely on these they will be a crutch so jst decidde now to install them in about 4 mo after you have good clean habits without them as with many tools like with hitting tab for a for loop - I asked a student to write a for loop and he could not do it after about 7 weeks because he only used the auto complete snippets. True story - and plus your future employer may not allow those tools or force you to use a different code editor. NO bueno. 
As with HTML and CSS, you can ensure better quality, less error-prone JavaScript code using a linter, which points out errors and can also flag up warnings about bad practices, etc., and be customized to be stricter or more relaxed in their error/warning reporting. The JavaScript/ECMAScript linters we'd recommend are JSHint and ESLint; these can be used in a variety of ways, some of which we'll detail below.
It is not very convenient to have to copy and paste your code over to a web page to check its validity several times. What you really want is a linter that will fit into your standard workflow with the minimum of hassle. Many code editors have linter plugins, for example Github's Atom code editor has a JSHint plugin available.Or in the command line itself

Using the JavaScript debugger
maybe chrome tools link here too



###### B. Ahhh BUG! Where? What? When? Why? How[to fix]? - Plan of Attack
Ask these questions when you have tried you best to write clean code and you still have broken code - everyday :
-----------------------------------------
**Where?** By where we mean *Where* in the code stopped on? A specific line of code and file name. Code reader computer reads the code from top to bottom. Code will not even run if there is what is known as a fatal error meaning there is a syntax error . So the code compiles first then runs. Languages are different but in javascript this is how it works.Some times its nestes in the error message Where is the origin of said running code. function etc. Find out the last function that worked what variables are being used and then you can find what stopped the code. Stack Trace  yellow red clicking on browser it takes you to the line of code if you you two screens if not it will go there if you click back to the code editor it wil be there. Not sure if its jsut Chrome or React or what. 
-----------------------------------------
**What?** What caused the code to stop? More specifically what is the error(message hopefully)? A bug duh. But what is that bug now that we have found it?
most the time you will know but not always 

Error reading - Understanding how Javascript is run this cannot be fully covered here so all can say is the computer (node js/bash terminal, or chrome V8 engine - the code runner/executor) is going to compile the code. The first goals is to find the point in the code at which the Error was instantiated. Node Bash console may tell you or Chrome/Mozilla tools in the console.

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't a resulting error message to direct you to the source of the error. 
What line of code did it stop on.? console log and variables in the vicinity - check for loops and if statements 
ReferenceError: Syntax error fatal errors read debug code error 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors
-----------------------------------------
**When?** Does it happen before running the code  Did it happen after a certain event like a click - if it is event based you can track those down.
-----------------------------------------
**Why?** undefined, imporperly used object or reference to an object or function
-----------------------------------------

How to fix it?

Check for typos its a common mistake for beginners just make sure to spell check each and every word and especially quotes multiple times before giving up especially if you think you did everything right use the tools mentioned above like JShint to fix syntax errors , missing curly brace. missing a period ro bad nesting on object reference, missing one [], missing (), 

run code after each function to make sure that piece works - hard to pinpoint if you wrote 10 functions and so forth 
you could Google how to fix and paste the error message this leads to our next sections so jump ther if neede.d 
variable is undefined or of the wrong type - type of console.log
console.log(the exact code inside a conditional )
Click on the error in the yellow or red big error message in Chrome and it will jump you right to the error in the code in at least VS Code and I think Sublime . I t can also show a list of functions that were fired that were all tied together and where it finally broke. 
comment out as much code as you can to pinpoint that area of code and make sure it is running okay expecially with callbacks and anything nested 

Making sure all your divs are in order proper indenting helps with this. 


When you cannot answer all theese questions that is a problem> Do this. Shotf=gun spray console logs all over With number comments or line disiticntion somehow. before and after ainside each and every funcitno till you find t. OCnsole log all vairbales being used beofre and after the funcitnn. 
###### C. HTML
With HTML 
what elements have what attribute like select inputs and input validation as properties how they work , how to Iframe work and 

use the Chrome debugger tools after validating it . check closing tags like in React IMG and BR HR tags all have to be closed. For our purposes VS code will catch almost all HTML errors and Chrome inspector tools are awesome hitting f12 to view source code to see HTML in action. 
elements and selector tool click into the DOM tree and click drop downs to dig deeper into the page . take a free youtube Chrome tools tutorials which could be my answer to anything . If not answered her google more. Honesty just go to a cool site and click around yes click everything and everywhere to see what happens hover over stuff click it hover it and back and forth. its very intuitive for most.  

###### D .CSS
CSS just play with the Chrome tools - up and down arrows on keyboard to play with pixels and percents . you can delete elements add stuff in change stuff. just get it right then copy paste styles into your code editor and refresh the page. 
click one div and it highlights the closing div or whatever tag
google cool buttons css or cool background css 
layouts containers wrappers and planning those out on paper

how to move this element space it right, how to do animations or what not and how to fix my image to make it look right.
Toggles display none and display block issues and that is mostly based on having the right javascript in place
how to center stuff and have nice layouts and knowing your selectors.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors Xpath for advanced stuff CSS grid Flexbox. 
use bootstrap or Materialize or a host of other like Foundation Zorb etc. UI kit
what is Cascading and when using bootstrap hw to override and all of that. 
Learn SASS to be more powerful and 
https://specificity.keegan.st/ specificity issues not to have !important or inline styles everywhere. 
layout issues float issues. only answer study good sites and see how they do it and take another tutorial then Practice practice practice is the best answer for that. X path advanced stuff. 
Responsiveness media queries and dealing with image sizing in general -
learning deeply about background attributes can h=be very helpful like position and images and repeating al that. 

honestly Lynda com has some essentials classes that are free if you are a SLC city library member 



###### E .JS


Finally knowing more about Javascript (or your language) in depth will understanding how it works behind the sense under the hood will greatly help you prevent bugs as well in helping you write code a certain way based on that . JavsSctipr the hard parts, doing toy problems and building stuff with Javscript and reading tons of Javascript books
Learn more will get you unstyck see Skill 6***

wrap Code blocks in these then usually just console.log(err)
try {
    Block of code to try
}
catch(err) {
    Block of code to handle errors
    //Example: 
    console.log("Error:", err)
}

Rollbar is a much used super cool and one of many many tools that try to catch bugs in production code and they have compiled a list of common errors . I can say with certainty the very first answer brought a big smile b/c YUP that is an error I have had hundreds of times 1. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property read more here. 1, 6,7, and 8 are very applicable to javascript full stack devs and guaranteed you will see them in the future unless you are that rocket science guy or use super powerful linting tools. You won't need to learn rollbar that is more for Dev Ops people but jsut knowing of tools like it is helpful. https://rollbar.com/blog/top-10-javascript-errors/ - these won't make sense to you know _ so I am going to hope you come back and back to this till its a mastered skill.

HOW to fix it ?
My 10 most common errors done by me and fellow boot campers and beginners 

Debugging Checklist - just do all these steps several times to be sure before giving up and then never give up 
This mainly pertains to JavaScript or other code - HTML and CSS is a little different

1. Check for spelling typos everything HAS to be exact - even file names etc. most common one for beginners I would say including me.  many frustrating hours spent till you finally learn spell everything exact already. Most the time someone else has to look at it to be honest cause you cant see your won spelling errors. then someone else takes one look and says hey that is spelled wrong countless times this has happened . 
2. Check for undefined variables, log all closely related variables 
3. Check to see if loops are correctly used logically i.e. (let i = 0 ; i< arr.length; i++) operator is in the right direction. are you starting at a logical starting point, is the middle piece condition really a number many times you will be looping over an object or something that is not a number. hence no workey.
4. check conditionals to see if they are true or false or what they are and/or log immediately inside the loop or conditional and if the log logs to the console lat least you know the loop or conditional is true and loop works at least once.
if you don't know what line the code is broke on you have to use the VS Code/Node/JS debugger tools or Chrome dev tools under SOURCES for break points OR you can just console log my favorite ( hello 1 ) (hello 2 ) or more descriptive phrase like (inside for loop:)
5. Reference Working Code even pull up side by side of a working example 
6. Take a quick break come back with fresh eyes or even better get some other eyes on it especially with typos.
The reason that is needing to be said is that the very first hurdle to jump over is that code must be essentially perfect to work or run so typos will kill ya. 
7. Check file paths to linked css and JS files KEY trust me and exact spelling of said paths 
8. check to make sure the file is even linked if nothing is happening at all. JS particularly again countless times student have no idea why the code is not working - its not linked up - this is so key it was actually an interview question two times to why is this code not working 

9. For HXR requests the network tabs in Chrome tools is very useful . Also console logging any responses immediately is key to know how deeply nested your data is. before using it. Objects in general
Making sure asynchronous operations have returned before trying to use the values they return. For example, this Ajax example checks to make sure the request is complete and the response has been returned before trying to use the response for anything. This kind of operation has been made easier to handle by the introduction to Promises to the JavaScript language.

10. Error: Cannot find module 'C:\c\Users\Duran's coding comp\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\babel\lib\cli.js'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:547:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:474:25)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:693:10)
    at startup (bootstrap_node.js:188:16)
    at bootstrap_node.js:609:3
    npm install or its somehow lost so jsut re install it and make sure file sturcture is such that the node modules exist in the folder.  Node modules are literally plisttle pacakges of code someone wrote to do stuff and you call them into action into your code to do that stuff they proclaim to do so you don't have to write the code yourself - rememebr to go look at the node modules for a particualr 
CHeck the pacakge.json and see if it is listed in dependece (or dev deveopedices) also note the version.

Runnign the right file? drag file into command linke in vs code. and kill all other insatnces of node if you can - use task manager on windows a nd activity moniter on mac

F. General Libraries and Frameworks Troubleshooting Tips 
express - full stack how to send data to back end and back to front etc. 
each libariy ahs its own error messags so all these princiels can appy there.
any framework library debugging its about finding code that it every similar in purpose and is working on stack-overflow , codepen js bin and the like then just going over the DOCS and really understanding how stuff works https://www.javascripting.com/
PRO TIP:
Better you learn real "vanilla JS the better off you will be" 
PRO TIP - DOM manipulation is a skill is called grabbing elements on the page to do stuff with that is the starting -  jQuery or React /Angular all have different ways but learn vanilla first well . 

#### **Skill 2: Google-FU** 
Programming is also one of the most frustrating things you will ever do.working through that frustrating feeling.there is almost certainly a solution out there. after hours of digging I have found help for very tough complex problems 
3.You will hear often from TAs and Teachers just Google it but this doc is for expounding on that a bit.
 google can be intimidating.

stack overflow  why waste time looking at the question the bad code just jump to the green check marks - etc 
 Now copy and paste the error message and google it looking for stack overflow type articles - then share or bookmark it to never have to google it again and save others the same frustration
be sure to stripe out your local info and just google the generic error. with like our file name etc. cause no one on Google has the exact file name or at least less people.
Your answer could be in a video it could be in a git hub issues post, it could be on reddit. 80% for me are on Stack overflow and 15 percent in the git hub issues threads. this is more common with packages cause that is where people complain about the package and the authors respond and address them and 7% just out there. 8% in cool tutorials in medium or similar articles.

how to scan stack overflow fast look for how many votes ALWASY read the comments below I have solved many problems with those EVEN if they have lots of upvotes 
green check mark and title of the post 

If following someones read me tutorial try to clone the repo and get it working all by itself exactly as intended by the author but on your machine then once that is done you can try to move pieces of it or all of it into your project. 

CAUTION and TIPS from the HOT SHOT PROs - Stephen Grider tips 25000 students (good for MERN stack so please check all his courses out well worth it in my opinion and I don't get paid to say that).
Don't ever take any code snippets you find online if you don't understand how they work.
Remember once As a result, any problem you've already solved will get a lot easier to solve next time.

You have already read this article in the prework but here it is again just so you can re read or Google another one like it to learn even more. 
[Googling better](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1315437)
google fu also google more articles like this one how to google fu or how to google for developers or many others 

Hint 1 - first and foremost Google the entire "thought" or "question" you have exactly as you thought it - and add words like examples of, how to, why ? and then the language like javascript on the end of it all - You can click over the right side in Google for last month or years results to weed out old results. If you are a google hater I would stop it now. There is evidence it has more relevant results for coders but that is highly debated so do what you want But when it comes to spelling things wrong Google is WAY better like WAY better at guessing what you meant so just I suggest using it.

How to Read Docs is a real job skill - learning new tech will  likely forever be a part of your job as a developer. Read the docs once then code some more then come back to the docs I promise they make more sense over time. 
HOW TO INSTALL
quick basic examples of how to use the BASICS. most complicated stuff is not in the docs. so getting it to work with your code FOLLOW exactly what is said and if it does not work double check then google your dev environment issues then maybe try to change it up a bit if needed - Being a pro developer is KNOWING the docs for a particular library or framework. 

go to the docs - try to get the code for the package or what not working independent of any other code IF you can " if that makes sense. then once working bring into your own code. sometimes the docs are not good enough for you use case. Then there are sites like JSBIN, Code Sandbox, REPLIT, where snippets of code are saved in a working order fashion to see in action.  Codepen NOW the risk of using this is you become the copy and paste guy and that will not get you a job 98 % of the time. SO do what you can to be the problem 

Medium, Stack overflow, Scotch.io Youtube, 
google with specifialy looking for a video cause it has links to other relatd videos on the side or click video on the saerch results

**Skill 3:"Thinking Like a Programmer"** 
Be a Problem Solver: 

& Pseudocode
If you find yourself in a project and don't know where to start. Read on. 
Details- Attention to detail like follwing a README step by step exactly. IF something is nor workign restart at step 1 and double check each step.  Computers are exact so be like them.
If you want be better at algorithm problems and handling nasty complicated code /data manipulation in your projects or even refactor and better your code . 
Trade offs CS algorithm class - more efficient, cost etc. 
it is said that is about trade offs start to see that 8 years off stuff  CEO stuff 

There is a common saying in programming "Rubber Duck It."

Walk through your code out loud to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck!) and pose your question. As you’re asking the question, the answer might come to you. so many times I have just asked my senior  or co worker devs a question and just asking it the answer came to me but I had to ask it out loud (or at least in a Slack message) verbalize or vocalize it 

write your program on paper. In a real world technical interview we call it white boarding but paper or whiteboard writing the code helps take you out of the help from a code editor or syntax errors etc and just focus on the solving the problem. 
Toy Problems technical Challenges thinking like programmer
Look up all the possible array or string methods on W3 schools or MDN and find out if any of them can help do something like sort, or whatever.  break things down into tiny functions that do one thing and do it well. 
Immediately handle edge cases - empty array zero negative numbers weird stuff 
Once solved a problem look at or google all the other answers to the problem this will teach you much. 
be able to go back and forth between data types like Number and string, working with indexOf and splice and slice and replace , join, split making a map over an object as taught by Grider push pop shift unshift - really Grider says its usually just have you seen that one before so do toons of them read coding challenge books and Code wars leet code and code fighters , Codility and so forth - timed eventually for interviews so you need to be good EVEN if you are one to think these problems have nothing to do with how I can build a site trust me it does help and employers do it anyways in most cases expect for start ups but still you eventually benefit by mastering these 

break down pseudo code and know the language more and more of what it can do understanding for in for of and map Number and toString - again playing around with nested objects doing stuff to the data inside them and so forth will come up in real coding i promise and reg ex
manipulating, checking, tool box: conditional, loops, methods on that data type - 

Never write a line of code you never FULLY understand - at first this is obviously too much to ask but as time goes on make sure you know and can explain out loud every single detail of every character or line of cod.e I have asked many students what is that or what does this mean exactly and they say they know but can't explain it.  CEO code smith says world class engineers master the skill of technical communication and you will be asked by employers to explain code so get to it.Try pair programming for a bit with someone so you can see how others think and you will grow a lot.  
Take some MIT Stanford Harvard free real CS classes online 
Introduction to Programming Logic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNyvRP6HzhA&feature=youtu.be

Pseudo Coding - A real story - It happens all the time
Breaking things down into small steps: Story student comes after projects were planned and started and says I am supposed to make this button click and do this and that and all this and have no idea where to start. 
I then showed the student how she knew exactly how to do each and every thing she was assigned but was not breaking it down to see that. At first this will seem annoying but it will help you break down tough problems into manageable bite size pieces. Just ask yourself what is the exact thing I am trying to accomplish right now and write it down in pseudo code - now Google that exact phrase in a general way - CEO code smith  research research research and no coding then you have the copy and paste from stack overflow all your answers. You want to be in the middle in the "independent problem solver" zone. 

After your second language, you'll get much faster at picking up new languages. You will see patterns emrge and things like React handlebars all build on previous patterns. 
according to the MIT course algorithm that class shaves off about 8 years of experience. trade offs efficiency etc. algorithms course from a pro I respect says just having had that problem is the almost only way to solve it hardly anyone very very rarely someone come up with some answer to a really tough algorithm like Recursive Fibonacci but those having studied it before hand will be able to pass the interview. that is why books like cracking the coding interview are popular. 

MIT algorithms class lots of JS free books etc. algorithms helping you be better code faster 

OOP - understanding basically that all of coding is mostly 
Function do do one thing and do it well
Functional  
Declarative 
OOP 
and just in general understanding how compilers work and what programming is in general 
patterns MVC , React Container/Presentational 
Clean maintainable code - maintainable lots of time has to do with learning these types of things. the =overall style and architecture of yoru code MVC and organization. General functions resuable 
Get smart - Microsoft  Podium - if learning is always there and problems solving requires elegant creative solutions then analytical thinking critical thinking skills are key Steve jobs Law school skills quote. 


**Skill 4 : Getting Outside Help**
Use Slack chat groups, Facebook Groups, Meet-ups, Office Hours, Tutors, these are real people not Google, Videos, Tutorials, ReadMe etc. Slack is by far the best but for some things Facebook group comments and other message boards like Git Hub or Reddit can be huge help as well. 

I was helping someone at the UofU bootcamp when they asked a quesiton about React native Tab navigaotr. I did not know the answer off hand and our first google saerches led to nothing.  I told him to slack it out in a specific channel for that tech and he got the exact spot on answer in less than minutes. he promptly joined the Slack channel I recommened and also told him to post it in Facebook Group for React native at the same time.  WIhtin 2 miniutes the exact anser came to him by some awesome fellow coder. It was a link to the full explanation we had never found. 

I have also been helped by Slack messages many times. There are a few things I have learned in doing so. Basically the rule is jsut respect the community common sense type of stuff.  If you care to have it spelled out here are a few tips. 

1. - Slack the question out to multiple places at once if it is super urgent - when is it not urgent to get help..? ;P. You won't always need to do this but it can help you see where and how fast helps come and what quality of help from each source. If no one answers the question within like 40 min. it won't help you that much get unstuck anywasy so delete the message off the board so people don't waster their time. LIke if you solve it before them, it happens, rememebr just asking the question outloud usually helps a ton, then post the answer it might help out someone else. 

2. - Make it easy for others to help you without asking a lot of time consuming questions or really any quesitons. be exlicit and clear enough in the first post the best you can, many times clarification will  be needed. 

    For example - "I want to do .... with ...." x " tech...Here is what I have tried ....(code snippet) here is my error - please help ...this post (use a link of something related but not totally all there to show you tried to solve it on your own to no avail etc)- that allows gracious people to jump right in and help and not have to ask back and forth and spam the threads so much and spend too much valuable time. Be specific. paste code snippets using ``` code here ``` basically it takes practice. how can you ask in a way that someone else not looking at your entire code base be able to help. Less is definitely better cause its other people's time so JUST enought to get the exact issue across. Hopefully so that don't have to ask any clarifying quesitons but its okay if they do cause it means they want ot help.  

if the question is asked right more will be happy to answer. So if you get little help its very likely just the way you are asking 
I say this b/c I have asked questions and only got crickets till I delted the post and totally re wrote it so it actually made sense to someone not looking at your entire code base. I eventually learned how to write in a way people would be happy to help. Quick answer usually come in the form of oh yeah do this, jsut add this line of code, change that line to this, or here is the link that helped me solve it. 

3. - ALWAYS give great thanks to someone who gave you FREE help. More likley they will help again and others will see it too. It creats the feel good vibes that make it all work. Give credit where credit is due type of thing. 

4. - Pair coding in class or after class or going to freecode camp or other local coding meet-ups have many of them have group coding time to help each other out 

SLACK CHAT - "Where work is done"
Here is a list of totally free public Slack groups: CodeNewbie, Code Buddies, and Career Change, Coders. There are literally lists complied that have over 1000 groups 
https://blog.standuply.com/the-ultimate-list-of-400-slack-communities-2a7f3954f1d3?gi=a6a2c5ba0a47

UoU bootcamp channel - all channels 

FACEBOOK -
There are Facebook "Pages" and "Groups" - both can lead to some help. These are just some of them. 

Web Design and Development
https://www.facebook.com/groups/websworld/ 

freeCodeCampEarth ( also most states and/or cities have more local groups)
https://www.facebook.com/groups/freeCodeCampEarth/ ,

JavaScript
https://www.facebook.com/groups/JavaScript.Programming/ ,
https://www.facebook.com/javascriptJS/ , 

FreeProgrammingBooksAndCourses https://www.facebook.com/FreeProgrammingBooksAndCourses/ , 
 
JSWeekly
https://www.facebook.com/JSWeekly/ , 
https://www.facebook.com/react/

The React and React Native groups are helpful jsut look for the groups with the most people in them and ask to join. 

Finally you have Office hours and optional Tutor (ask Corrine and instructors about this ) If you are willing to put in the time it will come to you. You have a support network. Never take the easy way out at least come to office hours and get a C level HW with their help is better than incomplete since there is no GPA based final grade. 

Do you want to challenge your self and get help to learn new tech not taught in the curriculum?

Office hours at any point if you would like to learn outside topics not covered in the course request that it be taught in office hours mini lecture format by TA or instructor IT YOUR TIME> - use it Redux, Flexbox, CSS GRID, Selenium,React native, Docker etc. OR want to have a group review of the class content we can and would love to do that ,

Also check out :

FreeCodeCamp Message Boards, MDN Learner Area boards and tons more. 

I promise eventually you will be the one helping out and you will not really be the one asking the questions but use these resources as much as you need as a NOOBIE.

**5. Master Your Workflow Tools Better & General Tips**
These are basically time saving, gray hair stopping tips stress and frustration. Not going to techically make or break the code but can save time effort. 

Workflow and Tools VS Code GIT/Terminal - master your tools the proverbial tricks of the trade - swing the hammer a certain way even work smarter not harder. 
Things like being able to create new branhces and merge stuff in so you dont break working code with experimentation new features 
Time Saving Frustrations saving skills
Master your tools
hot keys like up arrow and VS code tricks can save lots of time and frustration. like dragging the file down to terminal to run it and knowing how to save all files with save key and on and on - using things like Replit to run JS and Chrome dev tools to fix UI issues CSS and HTML problems of any sort. using the debugger tools in VS code and Chrome. 
Tons of courses on your code editor of choice.  VS code in partifualr is gaining speed and has more powerful extensions and new tools coming out each month. 
Keyboard shortcuts 
VS code debugger tools (the no bug symbol of hte left) You can run a node debugger instance and chrome tools from VS code all for a front end back end debugging "line by line" experience.
All the bars (bottom tip left right ) all have veyr pwoerul stuff play around with them. 
VS code hot keys

https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf
Prettier
Snippets (React and HTML etc *EMMET)
Terminal TAB UpArrow cd ~ if you don't know those you should.
ESLint - This tool was mentioned above in writing Clean code point. 
Beatuify 
OPen in Browser
New SQL tools being built right in for connecting and viewing data
https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools
PLAN with detail 
Use project management tool like Trello !  break stuff down all that is applicable here .This was stated during a retorspective of uof tudnets they wished they ahs planned orgainzed better with Trello. Organization is said to have cause less repeat work and planning is well everything.
draw.io or Google version to plan apps out 
Save the best for last. Commit and push often - I repeat commit and push often - YOU Will face a day when that will save you so much headache  Back up, back up, back up. 

Learning your tools will help you get unstuck.

**SKILL 6 Learn How to Learn for Mastery**
Really this section is about knowing something - taking the learning to a level of proficiency or mastery - so can you do it on your own develop a skill.

1. Learning aka Master New Content Fast learning how to learn - its on countless job postings as real skill. so do it. 

As a benchmark, consider spending 70–80% of your outside class time writing and reviewing code. Only the remaining 20% is for other passive activities. If you are watching a tutorial or long course you are either coidng line for line with the instructor or you are pausing the video periodlically to go put into practice what you are learning.

  build stuff build stuff anything just build little sandbox stuff watching tutorials is like listening to how to speak Spanish cds all day and never saying a work in Spanish or never going to a Spanish restaurant for example and practice the phrase learn by doing 
Get it working then refactor
Learning Mastery and Pro Tips:
Always be coding! Language Center whether it be programming language or human spoken language is only learned by speaking and in this case coding. 

Apply what you learn - one of th msot skilled proffesors I ever saw used a quiz one quesions about an [irnciel oin the coues e we had to dfine it for the ansere and the other part of the quiz was to go and find that principle working in a real world current news aritcle of some sort and imemedlaeyt show with graphs and what not how the princpele was applicable to the aritcel. I still remmeber some of those aritlces pop quizzes and the stories. APplication fast . KEy.

HW and Sandbox
https://alternativeto.net/software/js-bin/
Even better make your own folder called Sandbox for trying new stuff you could even have one for each language. react-sandbox , js-sandbox , etc. 
https://codesandbox.io/
https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/
HW should build on class activities. So make a sandbox and try to rebuild every single thing done in class 
Watch the Videos in the VideoGuide.md for each week and code along. 

write an article just like this one and the many you find and read and it helps you master the content even make a Youtube video you could even put on your portfolio "your tutorials" I once spent 3 hours a a problems then found a 5 minute fix so I made a video and got 78 50 views. Employers like that you contribute to open source and also in my opinion to the coding community in general 
helo out on stack overflwo and slack.

Make sure to Proof read the other README for lots of euros and maybe cut it all out and check the prework for all that debugging advice I found somewhere  . check my full stack mastery github repo and then ship this to medium and the repo

Falshcards - jsut phsycally going thorugh teh motions tons of reaserch on that . 

Mastering all technologies taught in the course. You'll learn so much in this bootcamp, it'll make your head spin. The skill you're really trying to pick up: learning how to teach yourself new technologies using online resources.we have countless resources for you so just ask if you are not finding what you want on Google 

Hwo to do more: how can I use for loops conditionals and OBjects strings ,arrays(and their methods) and fucntions to make stuff happen - how to tell a computer to bring my idea to life. Callbacks, objects communicating with other objects by methods and using theri values to track stuff "how to use Javascript to .....?" or just "... Javacirpt" 

Learning How to Learn - One of the most important skills you will learn in this program is how to independently learn. This course grounds you in a methodology.
Learn from others:

HAs a great list of resouces 
https://github.com/AllThingsSmitty/must-watch-javascript
anythine awesome https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
must watch 
free JS books 
Livecoding.tv - Watch (and chat with) developers live as they code projects. Great for seeing the thought process of other developers. It's also fun to watch them struggle with bugs.
TwitchTV - Programming - Similar concept as Livecoding.tv.
YouTube:

LevelUpTuts - Great (free) resources for taking your web development skills to the next level. Both novices and advanced developers will find plenty to learn from here.

LearnCode.academy - Another great resource, particularly for advanced topics on JavaScript, jQuery and Angular.js.
open source, volunteer work family friends on facebook ask around to offer free work as way to build portfolio. or accept money too 
sandbox have fun make cool stuff that interests you . i am a single guy and made a cool dating app and that is how I learned React. 

take a tutorial but then code 

If you are stuck Revisit What You’ve Already Learned its really hard to learn all the first time through go back and see if you missed something in the lesson materials. Only after months of developing and a revisit to the DOCS was I able to grasp them. Reading and learning from the DOCS is tough at first. So don't give up. 

CONCLUSION:
These all should be skills[the ability to do something well; expertise] which come from habits[an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary]. 

Little checklist to reference CHEAT SHEET - 
1. Debugging [Error Knowledge, Checklists, CLEAN]
2. Google-FU aka Googling [Exact full thought, Date Filter, By Language, Skimming, DOCS, "Examples of" && || addding Codepen or Video]
3. Thinking Like a Programmer [Patterns, Generalize to Reuse, DRY, Psuedo-Code, Toy Problems aka Algorithms Practice]
4. Getting Outside Help [Slack, Facebook, Others]
5. Master Your Workflow Tools Better & General Tips [Code editor, Git, Terminal, Dev Tools] 
6. Learning to Learn(for Mastery) [Review, Practice in Sandbox, Share, 75/25 rule]

Code Always. In sales it goes "alwasy be closing," at the languge center I taught at for 3 years it was "Always Speak Your Langage." Learning that sticks (so knowing and gaining skills) requires "Action" my friends.  

#### 3 Things About the Author - Paul Murff
Goal Achieved.
I successfully landed a well paying full stack MERN developer job just 8 months after writing "Hello world" (everyone's first line of code duh). I bascially more than doubled my income with about a $15k investment combined with hard work that equaled lots and lots of 13 hour coding days.  

Knows how it is - no, for real I do.
I have close to 2 years programming experience at present time of this post. As a side note I taught beginner Spanish for about 3 years before coding and was a trainer for 1 year before that. I like to think I understand what a NOOB thinks and feels like then as a teacher what it means to guide them, including myslef, to proficiency. 

3rd time is the charm - Mastery can take time.
Education wise I have essentially been through 3 full web developer boot camps. 
1. Online through Udemy, A "Complete Web Developer Bootcamp" Course and lots of other full stack MERN courses combined with Lynda.com's "Become a Web Developer Learning Path" courses.
2. DevMountain 13 week immersive course, certified graduate.
3. By proxy/observer/grader/tutor etc. working as a TA with the University of Utah Web Developer Bootcamp Flex 6 month Course now on my second cohort.
